## **Label Encoding in Machine Learning**

## **What is Label Encoding?**
Label Encoding is a technique used in machine learning to convert categorical data (text or labels) into numerical form. This is essential because many machine learning algorithms cannot process categorical data directly and require numerical input.

## **How Does Label Encoding Work?**
Label Encoding assigns a unique integer to each category in a feature column. The mapping is arbitrary but consistent within the dataset. For example:

## **Pros and Cons of Label Encoding**
## ✅ Advantages:
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Works well when the categorical variable is ordinal (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High").

##❌] Disadvantages:
- May create misleading relationships in non-ordinal data (e.g., "Red" is not greater than "Blue").
- Can cause a **label bias problem** where algorithms interpret higher values as more significant.

## **Alternative: One-Hot Encoding**
If the categorical data is nominal (unordered), One-Hot Encoding (OHE) is a better approach. It creates binary columns for each category to avoid misleading relationships.
